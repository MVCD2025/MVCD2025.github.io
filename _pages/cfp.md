The recent surge of AI-driven design methods and tools is rapidly transforming the design landscape. However, there is still a limited understanding of how different types of AI can contribute to various design tasks across disciplines, as well as the real-world challenges design researchers are facing in the context of product and service innovation, such as balancing inherent trade-offs in human-AI collaboration (e.g., trust vs. ownership; novelty vs. feasibility; efficiency vs. learning; scalability vs. cost; transparency vs. usability). In this one-day hybrid workshop, we aim to deepen our understanding of AI-driven innovation by synthesizing both published and unpublished works to establish best practices, identify challenges, and outline future research directions for using AI in design. 

We call for position papers or case studies (a 2- to 4- page including references in the CHI Extended Abstracts format, to be submitted by email to the organizer). We also encourage alternative submission formats, such as demos, or videos. Paper topics should relate to the participants' previous experiences with utilizing AI for design in research or projects, as well as their insights and challenges in AI-driven design or design innovation with AI more broadly. Submissions will be selected based on relevance and quality, with a focus on ensuring diversity among participants. All accepted papers will be presented, provided at least one author attends the workshop and registers for at least one day of the conference. Following the workshop, the accepted submissions and materials generated during the workshop will be published on our website.
