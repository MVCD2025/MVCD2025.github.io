The workshop will be a full-day event, divided into two main parts:

- **Morning Session**: Starting with a keynote presentation to inspire discussion, followed by participant presentations of case studies on cutting-edge AI design innovations.
- **Afternoon Session**: Focusing on exploring methodological approaches, challenges, and debates around embedding responsible innovation (e.g., ethical, sustainable, inclusive, equitable, and just AI) in next-generation AI design processes.

The workshop will conclude with a collaborative development of a conceptual framework synthesizing the discussed ideas, along with establishing a research agenda. The preliminary schedule is as follows:

**Table 1: Proposed Workshop Schedule**

For in-person participants at CHI, we will provide a physical version of our bespoke tools to create a participatory and immersive experience. Online participants will engage with digital versions of these tools, enabling collective design of pathways for More-than-Generative AI Innovation Futures through three key activities:



### Activity 1: Comprehending the Challenges and Trade-offs in Human-AI Collaboration for Design
We will apply *giga-mapping* techniques to map AI innovation across various applications, sectors, and scales. This mapping will help participants critically assess how AI innovations interconnect, disconnect, or disrupt one another, moving beyond solely generative applications to consider diverse forms of AI innovation in HCI-design.

### Activity 2: Envisioning the Future of AI in Design Research and Practice
To explore the pace of change in next-generation AI innovation, we will use *pace layering* methods:
- Different functional layers interact and operate interdependently.
- Fast layers like "technology" and "culture" drive innovation, while slower layers such as "infrastructure" and "nature" provide stability.

This activity will help participants envision responsible AI design trajectories across near, medium, and far futures, leveraging their diverse expertise.

### Activity 3: Establishing a Research Agenda for More-than-Generative AI Innovation Futures
In this final activity, we will synthesize insights from Activities 1 and 2, developing a research agenda with recommendations for More-than-Generative AI Innovation. 

Our approach combines customized tools to create a space for critical and creative discussion on the relationships between stakeholders, systemic trade-offs, and potential unintended consequences in developing pathways toward responsible More-than-Generative AI Innovation in the HCI-design field.
